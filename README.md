# BLE WebAuthn Token for Android

This application is an attempt to implement a WebAuthn compatible Bluetooth token for Android phones.

The project is based on [kshoji/BLE-HID-Peripheral-for-Android](https://github.com/kshoji/BLE-HID-Peripheral-for-Android), as it started as a USB token emulation using HID over BLE, but now it implements a BLE WebAuthn token directly.

It works with testing sites like [webauthn.io](https://webauthn.io/) and also [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com).
